        description: "This project was for a literature course on performance, where we had to make a creative adaptation of Shakespeare's 'Twelfth Night' in any medium. As a collaboration with a friend, this project explores the idea of love and the self in a modern webtoon adaptation of Act II Scene IV. Here are a few snippets from the project. Here is the link to the whole project (it is designed to be read from a smartphone) : https://www.webtoons.com/en/challenge/twelfth-night-act-ii-scene-iv/list?title_no=762533",
